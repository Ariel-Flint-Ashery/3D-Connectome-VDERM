# 3D-Connectome-VDERM
Repository for code built during 3 month internship with Barabasi Lab (Oct 22 - Jan 23). In this project, we aim to build a diffusion-based method for density-equalizing the 3D connectome. The method will be built on the algorithm proposed by Choi et al. (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10915-021-01411-4.pdf).
